### Adrián Groglopo: The modern colonial modes of knowledge production - media and the securitization of colonial subjects
--> [facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/609949436205237/)

From the event description: _The lecture will be structured around three areas:_  
_1) an introduction to key concepts on decolonial critique and world system analysis from Frantz Fanons view on the (post)colonial system_  
_2) coloniality of knowledge and the imperial media_  
_3) neoliberalism in crisis and the securitization of the Other as a cultural hegemonic project in the Westernized media._  

_Adrián Groglopo is a lecturer at the department of social work at the University of Gothenburg. He is a project leader of DENOR (research network decolonial critique, knowledge production and social change in the Nordic countries), which provides a decolonial perspective on knowledge and education in the Nordic countries. As an articulation between racism, capitalism and patriarchy generated through the processes of domination that became globalized in the wake of colonialism, coloniality (as the legacy of colonial knowledge and relationships, as well as global politics, geopolitics and world-colonial/modern system) continues to produce structures of inequality that render people as non-existent. DENOR addresses coloniality’s social, political, epistemic and ontological production of absences, and their connection to contemporary problems connected to knowledge and education in the Nordic countries, as well as examine how these may reproduce or be complicit with the problems of racism and social exclusion we are facing._

##### 3.12.19 - guest talk #3:
### Patricia Lorenzoni: When is life grievable? Media representation in the age of migration and increased border control
--> [facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/2538111769767501/)

I will talk about Butler’s concept “politics of mourning”, and relate to media representation of migration and migrant death, with concrete examples from Swedish and EU news media. What are the unspoken premises in media report on migration. And, what can be done differently?_
